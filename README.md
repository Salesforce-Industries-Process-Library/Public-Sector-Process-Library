# Salesforce Flows

Salesforce flows that must be manually configured are available under the Flows folder. See [Salesforce Help](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.psc_admin_concept_psc_welcom.htm) for instructions to configure and run the flows.

## Authorize Referral for Provider Flow 
Enables caseworkers to authorize the service delivery by a provider. The flow updates a referral's authorization status, and shares the benefit assignment record related to the referral and the account of the benefit assignment enrollee with the provider user. The provider user can then easily track service delivery as benefit disbursements against the benefit assignment.
